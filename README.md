# Power Dice v1.0

#### What's new in 1.0:
- Players now have the ability to choose how many points are required for victory, between 5,000 and 20,000 points. Note that players can only enter the Hall of Fame with a score higher than 20,000!
- Players can now challenge each other to a series - the first player to 1, 2, 3, or 4 wins is the victor!
- A messaging system now alerts players to major events pertaining to power dice rolls, and informs the player if they're having an amazing turn!
- Major UI overhaul - Players can now keep and return dice by simply clicking on the dice - no more extra buttons! This also applies to rolling the Power Die and various Power Dice
- Fixed an issue where the second roll-off would reset to 5 dice

Power Dice is a fun and exciting variant on the traditional dice game [Dice 10000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_10000), and is meant for 2-4 players.  Players in Power Dice race 
to **20,000 Points**. Once a player eclipses the 20,000-point mark, each other player has one final chance to push their point 
total higher than their opponents' totals.  After the final round, **the player with the most points wins**.

Power Dice features a new set of dice that add a number of exciting mechanics to a player's turn.  After 'banking' rolled points on their 
turn, players rolls the Power Die and begin their Power Round, where they use the set of dice that they rolled on the 
Power Die to score bonus points.  The two stages to a turn are explained below

## The Standard Round

In the rolling phase, players roll five regular 6-sided dice in an attempt to earn points.  After each roll, a player can
choose to keep any valid point-earning dice rolled.  If at least one die is kept, the player can choose to roll again, or 
bank their points and enter the Power Round. If all five dice are kept, the player rolls all five dice again, continuing their
point total. Points can be earned as follows:
* A 5 is worth **50 points**
* A 1 is worth **100 points**
* Triples are worth **100x** the value of the side with triples (Triple 1's give 1,000 points)
* Quadruples are worth **2x** their corresponding triples value
* Quintuples are worth **4x** their corresponding triples value
* A straight (1,2,3,4,5 or 2,3,4,5,6) is worth **1,000 points**

**NOTE:** Points are only calculated for each roll, so triples, quadruples, quintuples, and straights must be kept in *one roll*.
(eg. Rolling two 5's, then another 5 on the following roll is worth 150 points, not 500)

## The Power Round

After the first phase of a player's turn, they roll the Power Die. They must use the corresponding dice that they roll on the
power die for their Power Round.  If a player rolls **POWER DICE**, they may choose which set of dice they use for their
Power Round.  Each set of potential dice is explained below.

### The Skull Dice

The skull dice offer a player the potential for big bonuses to their turn score, at a risk. Two Skull dice are rolled
by the player; each die has their '1' side replaced with a menacing skull.  
* If a player rolls two skulls, they lose **1,000 points**
* If a player rolls one skull, they lose points equal to **100x the other die's result**
* If a player rolls no skulls, they gain **200x the sum of their roll**

### The Chance Die

The chance die is, as the name suggests, a bit of a loose cannon.  Players can gain or lose a flat amount of points, lose 
their turn, roll again, or even **trade their point total with one of their opponents!**

### The All or Nothing Die

The All or Nothing Die is for times when a player has nothing to lose. In the final round and an opponent has an insurmountable
lead? No problem! A player who rolls a 20 on the All or Nothing die **automatically wins the game.** However, rolling a 1 causes the player
to **lose all of their points**! All other rolls have no effect.

### The Plus-Minus Dice

A true 50/50, the Plus-Minus Dice offers players a **high risk, high reward** option in their Power Round. Two dice are rolled; a
6-sided die on which three sides are positive and three sides are negative, and a regular 12-sided die. The roll is then added or subtracted
from the player's score total.

### The Tripler Dice

The safest bet among the power dice, the tripler can only improve a player's turn's score total.  The player rolls 3 red  6-sided dice, and if they roll doubles or triples, **their turn score is likewise doubled or tripled**.
